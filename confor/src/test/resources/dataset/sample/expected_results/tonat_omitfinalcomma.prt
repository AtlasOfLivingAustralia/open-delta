Poa L.

      Including Arctopoa (Griseb.) Probat., Neuropoa Clayton, Oreopoa Grand.,
Paneion Lunell, Parodiochloa C.E. Hubb., Poagrostis Raf. Culms (1-)4-150 cm
high; herbaceous.

      Habit, vegetative morphology. Annual, or perennial. Culms unbranched
above. Leaf blades linear, or linear-lanceolate (often ending in a boat-shaped
tip); 0.2-12 mm wide (rarely wider). Ligule an unfringed membrane, or a
fringed membrane (rarely).

      Inflorescence. Plants bisexual, with bisexual spikelets, or dioecious
(or gynodioecious, in subgenus Andinae). Inflorescence paniculate; open, or
contracted; not comprising ‘partial inflorescences’ and foliar organs.
Spikelet-bearing axes persistent. Spikelets not secund.

      Female-fertile spikelets, florets, fruit. Spikelets 2-11 mm long;
compressed laterally; disarticulating above the glumes; disarticulating
between the florets. Rachilla prolonged beyond the uppermost female-fertile
floret. Hairy callus present, or absent. Glumes two; more or less equal, or
very unequal to more or less equal (nearly always ‘subequal’, with the G1
somewhat shorter); shorter than the adjacent lemmas; awnless; carinate. Upper
glume (1-)3(-5) nerved. Spikelets with female-fertile florets only, or with
incomplete florets. The incomplete florets distal to the female-fertile
florets. Female-fertile florets (1-)2-13(-15) (the one-floreted species very
unusual, perhaps restricted to Malesia). Lemmas nearly always entire (very
rarely tridenticulate); pointed; awnless, or mucronate (2–3 mm terminal ‘awns’
in a very few species, e.g. in the southern South American P. flabellata);
carinate; without a germination flap; (3-)5 nerved, or 7-11 nerved (rarely,
e.g. in the Australian Neuropoa). Palea present; relatively long, or
conspicuous but relatively short. Lodicules present; membranous; nearly always
glabrous (occasionally ciliolate). Stamens 3. Ovary glabrous. Stigmas 2;
white. Fruit small. Hilum short.

      Photosynthetic pathway, leaf blade anatomy. C3; XyMS+. Midrib
conspicuous; with one bundle only. Many of the smallest vascular bundles
unaccompanied by sclerenchyma, or all the vascular bundles accompanied by
sclerenchyma.

      Taxonomy, distribution. Pooideae; Poodae; Poeae. About 500 species.

Zea L.

      Including Mays Miller, Mayzea Raf., Reana Brignoli, Thalysia Kuntze. =
Zea mays subsp. mays Culms 200-450 cm high; herbaceous.

      Habit, vegetative morphology. Robust annual. Culm nodes glabrous. Ligule
a fringed membrane.

      Inflorescence. Plants monoecious with all the fertile spikelets
unisexual. Inflorescence peculiar: the female axillary, comprising a stout,
spicate spadix with spikelets in few to several longitudinal rows, terminating
in a tuft of long pendulous styles (‘silks’); the male spikelets in terminal
panicles of spiciform ‘tassels’; not comprising ‘partial inflorescences’ and
foliar organs. Spikelet-bearing axes persistent. Spikelets paired; not secund;
consistently in ‘long-and-short’ combinations (male), or not in distinct
‘long-and-short’ combinations (female).

      Female-sterile spikelets. Male spikelets in pairs, two-flowered, with
many-nerved, membranous glumes. Lemmas and paleas hyaline, the florets with
three stamens and two cuneate lodicules.

      Female-fertile spikelets, florets, fruit. Spikelets not noticeably
compressed to compressed dorsiventrally; not disarticulating. Rachilla
terminated by a female-fertile floret. Hairy callus absent. Glumes two; more
or less equal; long relative to the adjacent lemmas; awnless. Upper glume 0
nerved. Spikelets with incomplete florets. The incomplete florets proximal to
the female-fertile florets. The proximal incomplete florets 1; sterile. The
proximal lemmas awnless. Female-fertile florets 1. Lemmas awnless;

NADP–ME; XyMS–. Midrib conspicuous; having a conventional arc of bundles; with
colourless tissue adaxially. Many of the smallest vascular bundles

      Special diagnostic feature. Fruiting inflorescence a massive, spatheate
cob, the fruits in many rows.

      Taxonomy, distribution. Panicoideae; Andropogonodae; Maydeae. 1 species.
Neotropical.

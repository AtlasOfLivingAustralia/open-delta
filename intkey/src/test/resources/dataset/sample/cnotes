*CHARACTER NOTES
#1. The data would be improved by inclusion of nomenclatural references. At
present, they are given only for genera not covered by Clayton and Renvoize
(1986).
#2. ‘Annual’: plants progressing from germination to seed
production and perishing, within that period. \par{}‘Biennial’
(not known in grasses?): a plant normally requiring two years to complete its
life-cycle, growing vegetatively in the first, then flowering, fruiting and
perishing in the second. \par{}‘Perennial’: a plant which
persists and continues growth for several to many years. Detectable in
herbaceous grasses by the shrivelled remnants of old sheaths and culms.
#13. In the absence of a suite of characters to deal satisfactorily with general
inflorescence form, this has to suffice. Note that the coded data are frequently
supplemented by important data comments, and forms for which these states are
inappropriate are described exclusively via comments.
#19. Currently a catch-all character, covering one-sidedness of inflorescence;
e.g. \i{}Dactylis\i0{}, dorsiventral rachides, etc.
#26. Data unreliable for large genera.
#31. An unsatisfactory catch-all character, but widely recorded and useful in
keys.
#68. ‘Maximum cells-distant count’: the maximum number of cells
separating any individual chlorenchymatous mesophyll or photosynthetic carbon
assimilation (PCA) cell from the nearest parenchymatous bundle sheath (PBS) or
photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cell. This parameter defines the
relatively unambiguous ‘one cell distant criterion’, whereby
C\sub{}3\nosupersub{} and C\sub{}4\nosupersub{} forms are reliably and easily
distinguished. By contrast, C\sub{}3\nosupersub{}/C\sub{}4\nosupersub{}
assignments by ‘radiateness’ of chlorenchyma, or by recognition
of ‘Kranz’/‘non-Kranz’ anatomy, are less
satisfactory: ‘radiateness’ is ambiguous and is often
misleading, and many C\sub{}4\nosupersub{} leaves (\i{}Arundinella\i0{},
\i{}Triodia\i0{} etc.) do not exhibit typical ‘Kranz’ anatomy.
\par{}The terms PCA (primary carbon assimilation) and PCR (photosynthetic carbon
reduction: containing Rubisco) are applicable to the cells and tissues of
C\sub{}4\nosupersub{} forms only. For these, the term PCR is preferable to
‘Kranz’, since it is directly indicative of physiological
function, and PCR cells do not always occur in ‘Kranz’ bundle
sheaths. \par{}For detailed discussion, see Hattersley and Watson (1975) and
Hattersley \i{}et al\i0{}. (1977).
#69. See Hatch and Kagawa 1974, Gutierrez et al. 1974(a) and 1974(b), Hatch,
Kagawa and Craig 1975, and Prendergast, Hattersley and Stone 1987. Species
samples in parentheses.
#70. Refers to the presence (XyMS+) or absence (XyMS–) of cells between
the metaxylem vessel elements and laterally adjacent chlorenchymatous bundle
sheath (CBS, ‘Kranz’ or PCR: C\sub{}4\nosupersub{}) or
parenchymatous bundle sheath (PBS: C\sub{}3\nosupersub{}) cells in the primary
lateral vascular bundles (i.e. in the largest bundles exhibiting both metaxylem
and protoxylem) of the leaf blade (see Hattersley and Watson 1976). When
properly applied, this unambiguous criterion reliably distinguishes NADP-ME
species (XyMS–) from PCK and NAD-ME species (both XyMS+). The terms MS
(mestome sheath) and PS (parenchymatous sheath) of Brown (1975, 1977) refer to
the supposed homologies of photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR,
‘Kranz’) sheaths in C\sub{}4\nosupersub{} forms. The MS
condition is identified by XyMS–, the PS one by XyMS+. Dengler \i{}et
al\i0{}. (1985) provide comparative ontological evidence in support of the MS/PS
hypothesis. \par{}For recent detailed discussion of C\sub{}4\nosupersub{}
anatomical tissue configurations and physiological types, see Hattersley (1992)
and Hattersley and Watson (1993).
#71-76. All the leaf anatomical data in these descriptions refer to preparations
made from the mid-zone of the laminae of ‘normal’, mature
leaves. To obtain reliably comparative data, avoid seedling and flag leaves,
culm leaves with blades reduced or missing, and conspicuously unhealthy
material. Attempted identification of leaf fragments should be conducted with
these sampling considerations in mind, and the results qualified accordingly.
For detailed discussion of these matters, and further information on character
state definitions, see Metcalfe (1960), Clifford and Watson (1977).
#78. Subfamilies updated from Watson \i{}et al\i0{}. (1985).
#79. Supertribes updated from Watson \i{}et al\i0{}. (1985), with name endings
changed.
#86. The phytogeographical Kingdoms, Subkingdoms, Regions and Subregions are
those of Takhtajan (1969). The data, which are complete, were provided by B.K.
Simon (1987). They are intended to reflect ‘natural’
distributions, insofar as these are determinable.
#87. ‘This project’ denotes original observations by Watson, or
for Pooideae by Macfarlane (1979) supplemented by Watson. Taxonomic realignments
(extensive in Triticeae) have been accounted for when using Metcalfe (1960).

	<h2>Saving output</h2>
	<p>Program output can be saved in files, or copied to the clipboard
		and pasted into other applications.</p>
	<p>Output from commands such as &quot;Describe&quot;,
		&quot;Diagnose&quot;, and &quot;Differences&quot; is normally
		displayed in separate windows. The contents of these windows can be
		printed, saved, or copied to the clipboard by the usual Windows
		mechanisms.</p>
	<p>The contents of the &quot;log&quot;, which can be displayed by
		means of the command &quot;Display Log On&quot; in the
		&quot;Settings&quot; menu, can also be printed, saved, or copied to
		the clipboard by the usual Windows mechanisms; they can also be saved
		via the &quot;File Log&quot; command in the &quot;File&quot; menu.</p>
	<p>The &quot;File Output&quot; and &quot;Output&quot; commands in
		the &quot;File&quot; menu produce output in special formats for input
		to other programs.</p>

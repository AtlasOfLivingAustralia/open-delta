	<h2>Dialog Boxes and List Boxes</h2>
	Many commands require you to specify the taxa and/or characters upon
	which the command is to act, and some also require you to specify
	character states. These commands automatically display a &quot;dialog
	box&quot; from which you can make your selection. Inside the dialog box
	are various buttons, and a &quot;list box&quot; containing taxa,
	characters, or states. Clicking on an item in the list selects the item
	(or deselects it if it was already selected). You can also
	drag the cursor to select or deselect multiple items. Some dialog boxes
	contain &quot;SelectAll&quot; and &quot;DeselectAll&quot; buttons,
	which select or deselect all the items in the list. The item currently
	at the &quot;focus&quot; of a list box is enclosed in a dotted
	rectangle, and is also indicated by an arrow. If you press the
	&quot;OK&quot; button (or its equivalent) without having selected any
	items from the list, then the item at the focus is automatically
	selected. Taxa and characters may be selected in groups from
	&quot;keyword&quot; dialog boxes, or individually from taxon and
	character dialog boxes. To switch between these dialog
	boxes, use the &quot;Keywords&quot; and &quot;List&quot; buttons.

	<h4>Using the keyboard in list boxes</h4>
	You can move the focus in list boxes by pressing the up-arrow,
	down-arrow, PageUp, PageDown, Home, and End keys, or by typing the
	number of the required item. The space bar selects or deselects the
	item at the focus.
	<h4>Advanced selection methods</h4>
	A set of taxa or characters may be built up by repeated selections or
	deselections in the keyword and taxon or character dialog boxes. The
	rules governing the process are as follows.
	<ol>
		<li>When a keyword dialog box is deactivated by pressing an
			&quot;OK&quot; or &quot;List&quot; button, the taxa or characters
			corresponding to the selected keywords are added to the set.</li>
		<li>When a taxon or character dialog box is deactivated by
			pressing an &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Keywords&quot; button, the
			selected taxa or characters are added to the set, and the deselected
			taxa or characters are removed from the set.</li>
	</ol>
	Note that taxa or characters cannot be
	<i>removed</i> from the set via the keyword dialog box. As control
	passes to and fro between the keyword and taxon or character dialog
	boxes, the keywords and taxa or characters that are currently in the
	set are automatically marked as selected. The fact that a keyword is
	<i>not</i> automatically marked as selected implies only that at least
	one of its taxa or characters is not in the set.

	<h2>The command line</h2>
	<p>Intkey commands may be typed in on the &quot;command line&quot;
		at the bottom of the screen. Commands consist of a command word, or a
		command word followed by parameters. You can learn to use the command
		line by observing the commands which are built up by the program when
		you use the menu system.</p>
	<p>Command words and parameters may be abbreviated, as long as the
		abbreviations are not ambiguous (the program will tell you if they
		are).</p>
	<p>You can edit the command line by using the left and right arrow
		keys, and the Backspace, Delete, and Insert keys.</p>
	<p>If a keyword (q.v.) containing blanks is used on the command
		line, it must be enclosed in quotation marks ("), or the blanks must
		be omitted. All taxon names can be used as keywords on the command
		line.</p>
	<p>Commands may also be read from a file. See the &quot;File
		Input&quot; command for details.</p>

<h2>Selecting Taxa</h2>
The taxa on which an operation is to be carried out (for example, displaying the differences between taxa) may be selected in the &quot;Taxa&quot; (right-hand) panes of the main window before specifying the operation. In Advanced mode, other selection methods are also available (see &quot;Dialog Boxes and List Boxes&quot;).
The &quot;Remaining Taxa&quot; and &quot;Eliminated Taxa&quot; lists behave as a single list when taxa are being selected. Clicking on a taxon selects that taxon and deselects all others. Multiple taxa can be selected in the usual ways, that is, by holding down the Shift and/or Ctrl keys while clicking.
The &quot;Find text in taxon names&quot; button in the &quot;Taxa&quot; toolbar allows you to search for text in the taxon names in the &quot;Taxa&quot; panes. The authorities are also searched, although they are not normally displayed in these panes. The names found are selected, allowing them to be used in subsequent operations (for example, in requesting information about the taxa). By default, all the matching names are selected; &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Previous&quot; buttons allow all the selections to be seen, if they cannot all be displayed together. Clicking the radio button &quot;Select one&quot; cause the names to be selected one by one; the &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Previous&quot; buttons then move the selection to the next or previous matching name.
By default, only the names in the &quot;Remaining Taxa&quot; (top-right) pane) are searched. Check boxes allow the search to be extended to the &quot;Eliminated Taxa&quot; (bottom-right) pane and to the synonyms (if available).

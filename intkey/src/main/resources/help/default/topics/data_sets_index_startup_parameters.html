	<h2>Data-Sets Index and Startup Parameters</h2>
	Data sets are normally selected from a dialog box, which the program
	displays on startup or when the New Data Set option of the
	&quot;File&quot; menu is invoked. The program generates this dialog box
	from a file INTKEY.IND which is normally in the same directory as the
	program. Entries in this file can be added or removed using Intkey
	dialog boxes which are automatically displayed at appropriate times.
	Also, the file can be edited with any text editor (e.g. Notepad, which
	is supplied with Windows). If there is a file INTKEY_.IND in the same
	directory as the program, the name of a data-set initialization file
	(usually INTKEY.INI or INTKEY.INK) is read from this file, and the data
	set is immediately loaded. This feature can be used to simplify the
	starting of an Intkey package on a CD-ROM. Some aspects of the
	program&quot;s behaviour on startup can be controlled by adding
	parameters to the shortcut target line, as follows. Press the Windows
	&quot;Start&quot; button. Select &quot;Settings&quot;. Select
	&quot;Taskbar&quot;; the &quot;Taskbar Properties&quot; dialog box
	appears. Select the &quot;Start Menu Programs&quot; tab. Press the
	&quot;Advanced&quot; button; an &quot;Exploring ...&quot; window
	appears. In the right-hand part of the window, double click on
	Programs, then double click on DELTA. Click the right mouse button on
	&quot;Intkey&quot;; a menu appears. Click on &quot;Properties&quot;;
	the &quot;Intkey Properties&quot; dialog box appears. Click on the
	&quot;Shortcut&quot; tab. Click near the end of the &quot;Target&quot;
	text box, and type in the required parameters, separated by blanks. The
	available parameters are as follows.
	<dl>
		<dt>filename</dt>
		<dd>Specifies the name of an initialization file (for example,
			C:\\ANGIO\\INTKEY.INI). The corresponding data set is then
			automatically loaded when the program starts, and the data-set
			selection box is not displayed.</dd>
		<dt>&#45;A</dt>
		<dd>Sets Advanced mode.</dd>
		<dt>
			&#45;G=<i>filename</i>
		</dt>
		<dd>Specifies the name of the (global) index file. The default is
			INTKEY.IND in the same directory as the program. You will need to use
			this option if Intkey is on a network drive for which you do not have
			write permission.</dd>
		<dt>
			&#45;H=<i>filename</i>
		</dt>
		<dd>Specifies the name of the &quot;Help&quot; file. The default
			is INTKEN.HIN in the same directory as the program.</dd>
		<dt>&#45;I</dt>
		<dd>Suppresses display of startup images.</dd>
		<dt>
			&#45;P=<i>filename</i>
		</dt>
		<dd>Specifies the name of a preferences file &#45; see help for
			the &quot;Preferences&quot; command. The default directory is the one
			containing the program.</dd>
		<dt>
			&#45;R=<i>filename</i>
		</dt>
		<dd>Specifies the name of the DELTA registration file. The
			default is DELTA.INI in the same directory as the program.</dd>

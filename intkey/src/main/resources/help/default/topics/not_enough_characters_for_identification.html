	<h2>Not enough characters to complete an identification</h2>
	<p>In some circumstances, you may be unable to use any of the
		available characters (for example, if your specimen is incomplete), or
		the program may report that there are no characters that separate the
		remaining taxa.</p>
	<p>If you have used the &quot;Use subsets of the characters&quot;
		button to exclude some characters, you could try using the button
		again to include all the characters. Other possibilities are as
		follows.</p>
	<p>If you have used the &quot;Error tolerance&quot; button to allow
		mismatches between the specimen and the remaining taxa, you could try
		reviewing the information you have entered, which is displayed in the
		&quot;Used Characters&quot; (bottom-left) pane. If you can see an
		obvious error, click on the relevant character. The program displays
		the box for selecting character states or entering values, and you can
		change the information you previously entered.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The specimen information that you have entered may be too
			broad. You can find out which characters separate the remaining taxa
			by selecting all the remaining taxa, and pressing the
			&quot;Differences&quot; button in the &quot;Taxa&quot; toolbar. These
			differences may include characters that you have already used. If so,
			you may be able to separate the taxa by selecting fewer states or
			entering smaller ranges for those characters. To do this, click on
			the required character in the &quot;Used Characters&quot;
			(bottom-left) pane. The program displays the box for selecting
			character states or entering values, and you can change the
			information you previously entered.</li>
		<li>The author may have set &quot;reliabilities&quot; of zero for
			some characters that were considered to be generally inappropriate
			for use in identification (for example, number of chromosomes). This
			prevents the characters appearing in the &quot;Best Characters&quot;
			pane. You can find out whether such characters separate the remaining
			taxa by selecting all the remaining taxa, and pressing the
			&quot;Differences&quot; button in the &quot;Taxa&quot; toolbar. If a
			useful character is found, you can access it by first pressing the
			&quot;Natural order&quot; button in the &quot;Characters&quot;
			toolbar.</li>
		<li>It may be that the taxa really cannot be separated by the
			comparative information in the database. Information available via
			the &quot;Information&quot; button in the &quot;Taxa&quot; toolbar,
			may help to distinguish them. The information may include
			descriptions, illustrations, and links to Web pages. The descriptions
			may contain supplementary free-text information and/or references, in
			addition to the comparative information from the database.</li>
